# Udacity-Data-Analysis-Nanodegree-Projects


A repository for my submissions for the 3 projects included in the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree. These are the finalised versions after recieving feedback on initial submissisons.

## Project 1
The task in this project was to investigate a dataset and try to find and study relationships in the data. 

## Project 2
This project focused on further statistical analysis and hypothesis testing. The notebook analyses A/B testing results for the old and new versions of a web page to evaluate differenc in user response to each.

## Project 3
The last project was more compehensive as it required going through the data analysis pipeline with additional emphasis on visualisation and presentation. It also includes a navigatable slide deck that present the final findings from the analysis. 



** html files included are either the notebook exported or a slide deck. They can be viewed in the browser to see the steps and results of the analysis.
